         <p>The keyPressed function determines the movement between the images. The user can use the right arrow to move forward and the left arrow to go back. The system uses a wrap logic for the boundaries. There is also a continuous loop. When the right arrow key is pressed on the last image, the index goes back to 0, returning to the first image. When the left arrow key is pressed on the first image, the index wraps to the last image. I learned about the wrap logic, and I did some research when trying to figure out how to meet the assignment criteria, and stumbled upon it. It is actually much easier than using the if statements. Also, instead of having the images stop once it reaches the last image, it goes back to the beginning. </p>
