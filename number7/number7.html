        <div id="sketch-holder"></div>

        <p class="journal">
            <strong>Reflection:</strong> The model depicts the inequity that often affects people who are privileged, who often have it easier, while those who don’t often face setbacks (the random lockouts), which makes it harder for them to succeed. Time makes the difference more visible. The user is able to see that the privileged user was able to complete the task much faster than the unprivileged user.  What I learned from this was how important it is to pay attention to detail when it comes to the code so that the outcome is what you expect it to be. Also, for some reason, when I go live, it takes me to a screen with the folders, and not the webpage. I tried fixing it, but nothing worked. So, that was a bit frustrating.
