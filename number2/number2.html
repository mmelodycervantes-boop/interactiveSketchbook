            <strong>Adjective:</strong> The adjective that I chose was anxious. I used the mouseX and mouseY input to constrain the mouse to one location of the frame. Nothing really changes for the sketch, beside the mouse shaking. The mouse shaking is used to represent anxiety in a contrained enviorment. It took me a while to figure out how to make the mouse shake, it was very tidius. I had to do a lot of research.
