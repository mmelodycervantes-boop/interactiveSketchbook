        <p class="journal">
            <strong>Reflection:</strong> The if/then statement that I used to create the sketch was, “If the walk sign does not turn white, then I remain on the corner waiting.” Therefore, the rule that I designed was that the user could not walk until the white square with the word “WALK” appeard. The user must press the mouse to make the “WALK” sign show, just as one would with the walk button. The “otherwise” statement is that if the sign does not show the user remains waiting, this is the default sketch. The user knows when there as been a change with the pulsing red “waiting…” text, turn’s to the “WALK” sign (square).
