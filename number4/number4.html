            <strong>Verb:</strong> The verb that I chose was energize. I learned a lot from the reading. Some of the things I learned were how to use the arrow keys (which I used in the code), what "dist(x, y, mouseX, mouseY) (< or >) radius" means, and how to track the finger, which I thought was cool to learn. A new thing I tried was using the arrow keys to fill up the boxes, which was "function keyPressed." I used the code in the textbook as a reference, but I had a difficult time figuring out how fill the box using the arrow key. I realized that I needed to include "steps" and "maxSteps" within the "function keyPressed." This affected my sketch's behavior by requiring the user to press the left and right arrow keys to "fill up with energy" or to "lower the energy status," instead of using the mouse.
