            <strong>Adective:</strong> I choose dreamy as my adjective becuase, I usually like to draw out some of my dreams. For this sketch I used the function draw input. Overtime, the lines of color continue to accumulate eventually creating a colorful work of art. I had a hard time at first trying to figure out the code, but I resulted to using the p5.js website as my reference.
