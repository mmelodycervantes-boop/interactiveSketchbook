         <p>Modularizing code made me think about how the user will interact with the code and if they would understand how to interact with it with a few words. A new interaction behavior that I added was the auto-advance mode (which was also displayed as a timer using the bar) and the dot indicator to signal which photo they were on. The sketch communicates more clearly than Sketch #8, as it shows the user that 5 photos are using the dots as an indicator, and the timer bar allows the user to see that there is an auto advancement feature. What feels more controlled in the sketch is the amount of time the user has to look at each image. </p>
