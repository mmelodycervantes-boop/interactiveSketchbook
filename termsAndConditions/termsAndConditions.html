<h1>Micro Project Idea</h1>

<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
<p>When thinking about the system I wanted to design, I thought of things people often try to avoid. I found that people often avoid reading the terms and conditions. The core rule of the system is that if the user skims the terms and conditions (without reading them), they will not be able to “accept” them. </p>
<p>Over time, if the system detects that the user is not reading the text based on scroll speed, dwell time, and check attempts, more text will be added for the user to read. If the user doesn’t even read the text, but instead goes to accept the terms and conditions, the text will be doubled, and the accept button will be unavailable/locked. If the user just skims the text, more text will be added as the user scrolls. A warning will also pop up to not skim the text, but to read it. If the user takes the time to read the text, the text will shorten by one word per second they spend reading. Eventually, once the user finishes reading, the “Accept Terms and Conditions” button will become available. </p>
<p>The system becomes uneven when more text is added as the user scrolls faster. It also becomes uneven when the text doubles at each attempt the user tries to click the “accept” button without reading first. </p>
<p>This idea is worth developing because it focuses on the user's actions and choices. I hope that with this, the user may learn or build the habit of reading the terms and conditions. The system is made to make the user feel some mild guilt and lose patience. It also seems like a challenge, and I would like to challenge myself. </p>
