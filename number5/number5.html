            <strong>Reflection:</strong> The rule that I designed was that if the maximum number of steps was reached, then it would be indicated that the box is energized. The “otherwise” statement is if the maximum steps were not reached, then it will indicate to the user that it was still “charging.” The user knows when the state changed when the box is fully yellow, and it changes from “Charging” to “FULLY ENERGIZED!”
