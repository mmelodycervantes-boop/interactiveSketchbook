            <strong>Idea 1: Priority</strong> Some people get a fast pass, others have to wait in line. The system will randomly assign the user to the fast-pass line, or the standard line. In the fast-pass line, the user can experience immediate responses, while the in the standard line the user can experience waiting and delays. For this design the input will be clicks, requests, or even attempts to access content or a move to a certain area of the canvas. Overtime the wait time grows longer for the standard users, while fast-pass users get quicker access over time. In the design delay appears with a loading screen, countdown timers, or a delayed reaction to a click. The user is meant to feel frustrated as a standard user and feel privileged as a fast-pass user.
            <strong> Idea 2: Terms & Conditions</strong> Some people read the terms and conditions, others don't and accept them. The system will be designed to make sure the user reads the terms and conditions by slowing down the progress as fast as the user scrolls. The system will track the scrolling speed and will not allow the user to click the "accept" button if it detects skimming. The input will be the scrolling behavior and the time spent on sections of the text. Over time, the text will grow longer the faster the user scrolls. In the design, the user will experience friction when the "accept" button can't be clicked or when more text is added. The interaction is meant to make the user feel some guilt and also tired of scrolling.
            <strong> Idea 3: Get Heard</strong> Some people get heard, others have to repeat themselves; this can cause an imbalance in communication. The system is designed for the user to repeat themselves by typing words repetitively in order to get a quick response; if not, the response is delayed. The input for this is the length of the messages, typing speed, and use of repeated words. Over time, the system will require more repeated words and faster typing from the user for the same level of response. In the design, there is a limit in the sense that there is a requirement of repetition or typing speed for the system to respond. This design is meant to make the user feel confused and emotionally tired.
